# Artificial Intelligence for Automated Protocoling of Emergency Brain MRI Referrals
In this project, different machine learning models (Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost) and deep learning models (Finnish BERT and GPT-3.5) were trained/fine-tuned to classify Finnish emergency brain MRI referrals according to the imaging protocol and whether to use contrast agent or not.

The source code for the project will be published here by the end of July.
